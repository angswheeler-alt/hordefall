# Hordefall

Web-first idle RPG prototype (see the game design doc). This build covers the core loop only:

- Five heroes (Marin, Bramble, Pyra, Nox, Solenne) auto-fight down a lane toward the enemy crystal.
- Gold from kills, stage clears and drifting chests; spend it to recruit and level heroes (x1 / x10 / max).
- Stats double every 25 levels. Element advantage: Fire > Earth > Water > Fire (4x), Light <-> Dark (2x).
- A boss every 50 stages with a 30 s timer. Losing drops you back a stage to farm until you tap "Fight boss".
- Ultimates (40x damage) unlock at level 30 as a stand-in for 3 stars. 2x speed and auto-ult toggles.
- Offline earnings for up to 12 hours: gold at your recent rate, plus stages up to the next boss.
- Big numbers use break_infinity.js. Saves to localStorage (server saves come later).
